Here's a detailed comparison of **Oracle vs. SQL Server memory management**:

---

### **1. Memory Architecture Overview**
| Feature | **Oracle Database** | **SQL Server** |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| Memory Management | Uses **SGA (System Global Area) + PGA (Program Global Area)** | Uses **Buffer Pool + Plan Cache + Worker Threads** |
| Automatic Memory Mgmt | **AMM (Automatic Memory Management) or ASMM (Automatic Shared Memory Management)** | **Dynamic Memory Management** (configured via SQL Server settings) |
| Default Memory Allocation | Manually set or automatically managed by `sga_target` | Dynamically adjusts based on workload |

---

### **2. Key Memory Components**
#### **üîπ Oracle vs. SQL Server Memory Breakdown**
| Component | **Oracle** | **SQL Server** |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Shared Memory** | **SGA (System Global Area)**: Includes Buffer Cache, Shared Pool, Large Pool, Java Pool, and Streams Pool | **Buffer Pool**: Includes Buffer Cache, Procedure Cache, and Log Cache |
| **Session Memory** | **PGA (Program Global Area)**: Memory allocated per session/process | **Worker Threads & Stack Memory**: Each session gets a worker thread with its own memory allocation |
| **Cache Management** | **Buffer Cache**: Caches table data for performance | **Buffer Pool**: Caches frequently used data pages |
| **Query Execution Memory** | **Sort Area & Hash Area**: Used in complex query execution | **Query Memory Grant**: Allocates memory for sorting, hashing, and aggregations |
| **Redo/Transaction Memory** | **Redo Log Buffer**: Stores redo log entries before writing to disk | **Log Cache**: Holds transaction log records before writing to `.ldf` file |
| **Temporary Memory** | **Temporary Tablespace & TEMP PGA memory**: For sorting, joins, etc. | **TempDB Memory**: Used for temporary tables, sorting, joins |

---

### **3. Memory Configuration Comparison**
| Feature | **Oracle** | **SQL Server** |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Memory Allocation | **Manual (Fixed)** or **Automatic (`MEMORY_TARGET`)** | **Manual (`max server memory`)** or **Dynamic** |
| Minimum Memory Required | ~**1GB+** for a small DB | ~**512MB+** for basic workloads |
| Max Memory Usage | **Limited by SGA & PGA settings** (`sga_max_size`, `pga_aggregate_target`) | **Limited by `max server memory`** setting |
| Query Caching | **Result Cache in Shared Pool** | **Plan Cache & Buffer Pool** |

---

### **4. Performance Tuning**
| Feature | **Oracle** | **SQL Server** |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Memory Advisor | **SGA & PGA Advisors** (`v$memory_target_advice`) | **Memory Reports in SSMS** |
| Auto Tuning | **Automatic Memory Tuning (AMM, ASMM)** | **Self-Tuning Memory Manager** |
| Manual Tuning | Set `sga_target`, `pga_aggregate_target`, `db_cache_size` | Set `min/max server memory`, `buffer pool extension` |
| Memory Contention Handling | Uses **LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithms** | Uses **Lazy Writer process** |

---

### **5. Which One Uses More Memory?**
- **Oracle**: Uses **more memory upfront** due to multiple components (SGA, PGA, redo log buffer, etc.).
- **SQL Server**: Uses **less memory initially**, but **expands dynamically** based on workload.
- **For large workloads**, **SQL Server consumes more memory** since it caches execution plans heavily.

---

### **üìù Summary**
| Feature | **Oracle** | **SQL Server** |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Initial Memory Usage | Higher (SGA + PGA pre-allocated) | Lower (Dynamic allocation) |
| Automatic Memory Management | AMM (`MEMORY_TARGET`) | Dynamic Memory Allocation |
| Query Performance | Faster with manual tuning | Faster with automatic tuning |
| Memory Expansion | Requires explicit settings | Expands dynamically based on workload |

üîπ **Oracle is better for fine-tuned manual memory control**  
üîπ **SQL Server is better for automatic memory tuning**
