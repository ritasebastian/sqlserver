### **Difference Between Asynchronous and Synchronous Replication in SQL Server**
SQL Server supports **replication methods** in **Always On Availability Groups (AGs) and Database Mirroring** for **high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR)**.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Synchronous Replication (SYNC)**
| **Feature** | **Details** |
|------------|------------|
| **Process** | Primary server waits for the secondary to confirm before committing transactions |
| **Data Loss** | **No data loss** (zero RPO) |
| **Performance Impact** | Slower, as transactions must be committed on both servers |
| **Latency** | Higher latency due to network round-trips |
| **Use Case** | High Availability (HA) where zero data loss is required |
| **Example** | SQL Server Always On AG with **automatic failover** |

### **How It Works:**
1. A transaction is initiated on the **primary replica**.
2. The **log block is sent** to the secondary replica.
3. The secondary **confirms** it has received and hardened the log.
4. The transaction is **committed** on the primary.

**‚úÖ When to Use Synchronous Replication?**
- **Mission-critical databases** where **zero data loss** is a requirement.
- **Automatic failover** between nodes in the same **data center or region**.
- **Low-latency network environments**.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Asynchronous Replication (ASYNC)**
| **Feature** | **Details** |
|------------|------------|
| **Process** | Primary does not wait for secondary; logs are sent asynchronously |
| **Data Loss** | **Possible data loss** if failover happens |
| **Performance Impact** | Faster performance on the primary |
| **Latency** | Lower latency than synchronous mode |
| **Use Case** | Disaster Recovery (DR) where high performance is more important than data consistency |
| **Example** | SQL Server Always On AG with **manual failover** |

### **How It Works:**
1. A transaction is **committed immediately** on the primary replica.
2. The **log block is sent** to the secondary replica **without waiting for confirmation**.
3. The secondary **applies the log when it receives it**.

**‚úÖ When to Use Asynchronous Replication?**
- **Cross-region disaster recovery (DR)** where latency is high.
- **Performance-sensitive databases** where speed is critical.
- **Read-scale workloads**, where secondaries are used for reporting.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Can You Switch Between Sync and Async?**
‚úÖ **Yes, you can switch between Synchronous and Asynchronous replication** anytime using **T-SQL or SSMS**, but **consider these factors before switching**:
- **Sync ‚Üí Async:** Possible anytime, but could cause **temporary data loss** in case of failover.
- **Async ‚Üí Sync:** The secondary must **catch up fully** before the transition.

### **How to Switch Between Sync & Async Mode**
#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Check Current Availability Mode:**
```sql
SELECT replica_server_name, availability_mode_desc 
FROM sys.availability_replicas;
```

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Change to Asynchronous:**
```sql
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [MyAG]
MODIFY REPLICA ON 'SecondaryServer' WITH (AVAILABILITY_MODE = ASYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT);
```

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Change to Synchronous:**
```sql
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [MyAG]
MODIFY REPLICA ON 'SecondaryServer' WITH (AVAILABILITY_MODE = SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT);
```

### **üîπ Summary: Which One to Use?**
| **Scenario** | **Use Synchronous (SYNC)** | **Use Asynchronous (ASYNC)** |
|-------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Data Loss** | **Not Acceptable** | Acceptable |
| **Performance Impact** | Higher latency | Lower latency |
| **Failover Type** | Automatic | Manual |
| **Location** | Same region/data center | Cross-region (DR) |
| **Read Workload** | Not primary use case | Good for read-scale |

---

### **üí° Final Thoughts**
- **Use SYNC for HA (zero data loss, same region, auto failover).**
- **Use ASYNC for DR (better performance, cross-region, manual failover).**
- **You can switch anytime, but ensure secondary is fully synchronized before switching to SYNC.**

üöÄ **Need help implementing this in AWS, Azure, or GCP?**
