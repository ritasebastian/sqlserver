### **🔹 What is Automatic Seeding in SQL Server Always On?**
**Automatic Seeding** is a feature in **SQL Server Always On Availability Groups (AGs)** that **automatically initializes and synchronizes secondary replicas** **without requiring manual backups and restores**.

---

## **1️⃣ How Automatic Seeding Works**
- When a **new secondary replica is added**, SQL Server automatically **creates a full backup and transaction log backup** of the primary database.
- These backups are **transferred and restored** on the secondary replica **automatically**.
- Once restored, the **Always On replication process starts**.

## **2️⃣ Manual Backup/Restore vs. Automatic Seeding**
| Feature | **Manual Backup & Restore** | **Automatic Seeding** |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Requires Full Backup?** | ✅ Yes (User must take it manually) | ❌ No (SQL Server does it automatically) |
| **Requires Transaction Log Backup?** | ✅ Yes (User must restore it) | ❌ No (SQL Server handles it) |
| **Replication Setup Speed** | ❌ Slow | ✅ Fast |
| **Best for Large Databases?** | ✅ Yes (More control) | ❌ No (Slower for large DBs) |

🔹 **Use Automatic Seeding for fast AG setup (small-to-medium databases).**  
🔹 **For large databases (500GB+), manual backup/restore is recommended.**

## **3️⃣ How to Enable Automatic Seeding**
### **✅ Step 1: Enable Automatic Seeding on Primary**
```sql
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP MyAG 
MODIFY REPLICA ON 'SecondaryServer' 
WITH (SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC);
```

### **✅ Step 2: Add a Secondary Replica**
1️⃣ **Open SSMS** → Expand **Always On High Availability**.  
2️⃣ **Right-click Availability Group** → Click **Add Replica**.  
3️⃣ **Select Secondary Server** and **Enable Automatic Seeding**.  
4️⃣ Click **Finish** → SQL Server starts automatic backup & restore.

---

## **4️⃣ Check Automatic Seeding Status**
### **✅ Query to Monitor Seeding Progress**
```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_hadr_physical_seeding_stats;
```
🔹 Shows **how much data has been transferred and remaining time**.

### **✅ Check Seeding Mode for Replicas**
```sql
SELECT replica_id, replica_server_name, seeding_mode 
FROM sys.availability_replicas;
```
🔹 Should return **`AUTOMATIC`** for the configured replica.

## **5️⃣ When to Use Automatic Seeding**
✅ **Best for small databases (<500GB)**  
✅ **Ideal for cloud-based SQL Server HA setups**  
✅ **Reduces manual work in Always On configuration**

## **6️⃣ Summary: What You Need to Know About Automatic Seeding**
| Feature | **Automatic Seeding** |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Removes Manual Backup/Restore?** | ✅ Yes |
| **Works for Large Databases?** | ❌ Not Recommended |
| **Fastest for Small DBs?** | ✅ Yes |
| **Needs Synchronous Mode?** | ✅ Recommended |
| **Monitoring Required?** | ✅ Check `sys.dm_hadr_physical_seeding_stats` |
